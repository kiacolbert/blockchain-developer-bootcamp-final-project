# Provenance

Decentralized provenance verification for physical art.

Artist register their artwork on the ethereum block chain and are the original owners.  When they sell their art, ownership is transferred and they receive royalties(TODO). Buyers never have to wonder about the authenticity of the work.

**Workflow**
1. Artist registers to contract.
2. Artwork image is uploaded to a distributed file store and a hash created.
3. Artist registers the hash to the contract as original work.
4. Artist sells artwork and transfers ownership.
5. No more questions of, "is this legit?"
